	2	Define MVC, what are the responsibilities of each piece?\
\
MVC is an architectural design pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: Model, View, and Controller. The controller is the piece that enables the interconnection between the views and the model; it is the intermediary between them, it doesn\'92t handle data logic, it just tells the model what to do. The view is the component that is used for all the UI logic of the application. It generates a User Interface for the user. Views are created by the data which is collected by the model component and only interacts with the controller. The model corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. It can add or retrieve data from the database and responds to the controller\'92s requests (because the controller can\'92t access the data in the database by itself). The model interacts with the database and gives the required info back to the controller.\
